# Kodi-Videofile-renamer
Three tools quickly thrown together by me. It helps to quickly rename Videofiles for Kodi manuelly. With this naming scheme Kodi can fetch Video data quite easally.
It just adds [S0x Exx] in front oj your existing filename.
Please note that I created this only for my personal use because I didn't find any Programm like this on the internet. I know this is just quick and dirty but works.
If you want to know how to use it read README.md
